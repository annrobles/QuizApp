Quiz app develop using swift

Excited to share my final project in iOS Programming Fundamentals! 📱🔍

I've created a native application for iPhone that tests your knowledge on a fascinating topic. 🧠💡

Here's what my app offers:

🔹 A set of carefully crafted questions based on a chosen topic

🔹 Each time you start the app, three random questions are presented

🔹 Choose one option out of four for each question

After answering the third question, the app displays your score:

✅ Score out of 3

✅ Tailored messages based on your performance:

Score 0/3, 1/3, 2/3: "Please try again!"

Score 1/3: "Good job!"

Score 2/3: "Very Good!"

Score 3/3: "Excellent work!"
